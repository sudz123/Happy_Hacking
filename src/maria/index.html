				<p>I'm a junior developer who loves to learn and discover the world. I love reading novels and comics (DC comics mostly). I'm that goody two shoes next door, the one who you'll really never notice until we have a conversation somehow, but even though I may not be as outgoing or extroverted as many of my peers, I am still fun to be around.</p>
				<p>There really isn't much to say about me. Sorry, I'm pretty boring. I guess the only interesting thing is I'm working on my app development skills, so that's something.</p>
