## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted language, most commonly associated with scripting for web pages, though it can also be used for non-browser environments like Node.js. JavaScript is a prototype-based dynamic language supporting many coding styles such as object-oriented; imperative; and declarative (functional programming).

JavaScript can be used to bring additional functionality and interactivity to a web page such as creating a to-do list, fetching data from various services, and so much more!

<small>Note: Please do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. While they share a trademark name, they are completely different programming languages with very different uses and syntax.</small>

## How do I write JavaScript?

JavaScript is a loosely typed dynamic language by default; which makes it really easy to pick up without getting bogged down in semantics. The syntax is very straightfoward for basic use cases.

### Examples

**Storing values**
```
var name = "John Smith";
var age = 25;

console.log("Hello " + name + "! I see you are " + age + " years old!");
// Result: "Hello John Smith! I see you are 25 years old!"
```

**Creating functions**
```
function greeting(name, age) {
  return "Hello " + name + "! I see you are " + age + " years old!";
};

console.log(greeting("John Smith", 25));
// Result: "Hello John Smith! I see you are 25 years old!"
```

**Changing the DOM**
```
// index.html
<button id="my-button">Click Me</button>
<div id="my-content">Click the button to change my color!</div>

// index.js
var button = document.getElementById("my-button");
var content = document.getElementById("my-content");

button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  content.style.color = "blue";
});
```

Before clicking button:
<div>Click the button to change my color!</div>

After clicking button:
<div style="color:blue;">Click the button to change my color!</div>

## How to use JavaScript
The most common and recommended practice is to write your JavaScript in separate files from your HTML and then import it using the **script** element.

```
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

It is recommended to place your script imports at the bottom of your HTML, before the closing `</body>` tag. This will allow content to be loaded without being blocked by the downloading of the script.

It is also possible to write JS directly within the `<script>` element, but this is not recommended in most situations as it becomes difficult to manage.
