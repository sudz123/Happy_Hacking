# About
My name is Sudarshan Kamath and I am hosting this repository for the month of October, 2018. The idea is to create a website over the month, about Open-Source Programming. This site is open to all forms of suggestions. Happy Contributing!

# IMPORTANT
Since this repository is gaining some momentum, I expect good grammar in all PRs. I expect proper comments in the code. The code could be trivial with a small change, that is totally fine. **When making changes to existing files, make sure you do not add more than one feature or change more than one component in a PR!** Also these file descriptions should be helpful : 

- *src* contains all the code
- *.html* files like these should not have css or javascript code ideally. If they do then remove it and add to respective folders.
- *styles* I want all the css files in this folder with proper nomenclature
- *Images* I want all images in this within sub-folders in this folder, according to the page they are on.
- **THE MORE THE STRUCTURED YOUR CODE IS, THE EASIER IT IS FOR ME TO REVIEW, THE HIGHER CHANCES THAT IT WILL BE MERGED**
